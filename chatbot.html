            <h2> What is AI-Learners?</h2>
            <p> <a href="https://ai-learners.com/" target="_blank">AI-Learners</a> is a Cornell start-up that makes learning easier, personalized, and more fun for kids with learning disabilities through educational math games and data analytics.</p>
            <p>I joined AI-Learnes as a web designer, working with the <strong>Game Development, Software Development,</strong> and <strong>Business</strong> teams to design new platform features that would provide more variety and attract customers.</p>

            <p>I worked on five meaningful design projects with AI-Learners. Each brought the company a step closer to acheiving their design goals and making a beautiful, accessible platform that parents, educators, therapists, and disabled students would enjoy using.</p>

            <h2>Project 1: UI Kit Redesign</h2>
            </div>
            <div class="side-padding">
            <p>Redesigning the UI Kit was not part of the original sprint plans; but, after I explored the website and company Figma pages, I suggested to my project manager that the current UI style could use a refresher.</p>
            <h4>Goal: design new UI that <strong>reflects current design trends</strong> and create a <strong>consistent, intuitive</strong> experience for the user.</h4>
            <p>After getting approval for the project, I documented everything that would need to be redesigned. The rest of the design team pitched in to help me expand and improve the UI Kit by making new buttons, headers, footers,toggles, and pop-ups, and more. We wanted <strong>softer edges with high color contrast</strong> in order to make it <strong>accessible for kids with disabilities.</strong></p>
            <p>Overhauling the UI Kit set the tone for the rest of our design projects that summer.</p>

            <h2>Project 2: Figma Reorganization</h2>
            <p>Since we often had to communicate with other teams, we realized that when we asked developers to implement new design changes or business to offer feedback, <strong>every designer had their own preferred method</strong> when it came to structuring their drafts and writing edit changes. Over the course of the summer, I <strong>formalized and documented the structure and organization</strong> of our company Figma pages.</p>
            <h4>Goal: organize Figma files in a way that <strong>clearly and immediately</strong> conveys design ideas, thus <strong>streamlining communication</strong> with other teams.</h4>
            <p>Not only did writing up a formal document help to standardize the style and flow of our designs, developers were able to <strong>quickly pinpoint</strong> what we wanted them to implement. Leaving design feedback for each other also became easier, as we could tell what was being currently worked on and what was an archived idea.</p>
