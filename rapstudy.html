          <h2> What is rapStudy?</h2>
          <p> <a href="https://rapstudy.com/" target="_blank">rapStudy</a> is a Cornell start-up dedicated to education through music. The rapStudy team is building an app that students K-8 can use to help them review and retain school content. We want to make learning fun and engaging for kids, so our product takes what students are learning in the classroom and transforms it into catchy, memorable songs.</p>

          <p>I joined rapStudy as a songwriter, but soon transitioned to working as a designer and researcher. I have worked on creating a unique, supplementary game feature that allows the classroom to review all together, and have also helped build our ever-growing UI component library. Currently I am designing features for our mobile app (coming soon!).</p>

          <p>Takeaways since joining:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>Keep things simple. Both teachers and students have a lot to do, and we want to make things easy and natural for them.
            </li>
            <li>Keep your goals in mind. Brainstorming can be fun and crazy creative, but it's important to root our designs in the purpose of our product: education.
            </li>
            <li>User test! There were many small details that we sweated over, but only the users can let us know if our design works for them.</li>
          </ul>

          <p>I'm grateful for both the design and interpersonal lessons and experiences I've had working with rapStudy, especially since I get to meet and interact with members from other teams, and I'm excited to continue growing with them!</p>
