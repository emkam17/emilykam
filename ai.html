            <h2> What is AI-Learners?</h2>
            <p> <a href="https://ai-learners.com/" target="_blank">AI-Learners</a> is a Cornell start-up that makes learning easier, personalized, and more fun for kids with learning disabilities through educational math games and data analytics.</p>
            <p>I joined AI-Learnes as a web designer, working with the <strong>Game Development, Software Development,</strong> and <strong>Business</strong> teams to design new platform features that would provide more variety and attract customers.</p>

            <p>I worked on five meaningful design projects with AI-Learners. Each brought the company a step closer to acheiving their design goals and making a beautiful, accessible platform that parents, educators, therapists, and disabled students would enjoy using.</p>

            <h2>Project 1: UI Kit Redesign</h2>
            </div>
            <div class="ai-project1">
              <img src="images/ai/example2.png" alt="ai old and new nav">
            </div>
            <div class="side-padding">
            <p>Redesigning the UI Kit was not part of the original sprint plans; but, after I explored the website and company Figma pages, I suggested to my project manager that the current UI style could use a refresher.</p>
            <h4>Goal: design new UI that <strong>reflects current design trends</strong> and create a <strong>consistent, intuitive</strong> experience for the user.</h4>
            <p>After getting approval for the project, I documented everything that would need to be redesigned. The rest of the design team pitched in to help me expand and improve the UI Kit by making new buttons, headers, footers,toggles, and pop-ups, and more. We wanted <strong>softer edges with high color contrast</strong> in order to make it <strong>accessible for kids with disabilities.</strong></p>
            <p>Overhauling the UI Kit set the tone for the rest of our design projects that summer.</p>

            <h2>Project 2: Figma Reorganization</h2>
            <p>Since we often had to communicate with other teams, we realized that when we asked developers to implement new design changes or business to offer feedback, <strong>every designer had their own preferred method</strong> when it came to structuring their drafts and writing edit changes. Over the course of the summer, I <strong>formalized and documented the structure and organization</strong> of our company Figma pages.</p>
            <h4>Goal: organize Figma files in a way that <strong>clearly and immediately</strong> conveys design ideas, thus <strong>streamlining communication</strong> with other teams.</h4>
            <p>Not only did writing up a formal document help to standardize the style and flow of our designs, developers were able to <strong>quickly pinpoint</strong> what we wanted them to implement. Leaving design feedback for each other also became easier, as we could tell what was being currently worked on and what was an archived idea.</p>

            <h2>Project 3: Page Redesign</h2>
            <h4>Goal: refine current page designs in order to provide <strong>accurate visual data representation</strong> and <strong>improve visibility.</strong></h4>
            <p>The Analytics pages on Figma did not reflect the current published pages on AI-Learners' website. Additionally, there were design inconsistencies across all five pages. I worked with my design peers to adjust small details and refine the wording for all pages.</p>
            <p>This page is primarily for parents and educators who want to check on their student's progress. It was crucial to make sure that all the data is <strong>clearly illustrated</strong> and that our progress trackers are <strong> easy to understand.</strong></p>

            <p>On the old videos page, it was not clear what video was currently playing, what video would play next, and what video was already watched. I referenced YouTube's playlist design to create a layout that would <strong>distinctly display</strong> the system status.</p>

            <h2>Project 4: Landing Page</h2>
            <p>Every company has a landing page that tells the visitor what the company is about and what makes their product special. <strong>Based on user research</strong> done by the business teams, the design team outlined <strong>different user goals</strong> and how we could address each of their goals and interests through our landing page.</p>
            <h4>Goal: showcase AI-Learners' mission, product, and definitive selling points by utilizing <strong>informative visuals</strong> and <strong>content hierarchy strategy.</strong></h4>
          <!-- <div class="ai-landing">
            <img src="images/ai/ai-flow.png" alt="visual flow">
          </div> -->
            <p>We analyzed other education companies' landing pages and worked closely with the AI-Learners business team in order to understand what sort of content would best fit. Additionally, we wanted emphasize the availabilty of site tours amongst the flow of information. We settled on a <strong>simple, easily scannable</strong> layout that could tell the user a lot in little words.</p>
            <p>(As a bonus, I got to dabble in iconography for the first time!)</p>
