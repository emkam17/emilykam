      <h2> What is Dandelion?</h2>
        <p>This summer, I joined <a href="https://originbootcamp.com/" target="_blank">ORIGIN,</a> an entrepreneurship program for undergraduate students who want to learn what it takes to start a company. Together, my team of five created <em>Dandelion</em>, a company that focuses on the social and emotional development of students K-5. Although <em>Dandelion</em> is not a real company, our whirlwind eight weeks showed us what it was like to go from ideation to product demonstration.</p>
        <p>My team was split into two parts: technical and business. As team lead I oversaw both sides, but focused mainly on the technical aspects of our prototype.</p>
        <br>

        <h2> The Problem </h2>
        <p> We sought to address one of the <a href="https://www.un.org/sustainabledevelopment/education/" target="_blank"> UN's sustainable development goals: quality education.</a> Since the COVID-19 pandemic, schools across the country shut down and students suddenly had to start remote learning.</p>
      
        <!-- <p> Initially, our idea was to gamify learning and create a site that would allow students to learn their school subjects by playing online games. However, our research revealed that there were already many existing programs that focused on academic learning, such as <em>Flocabulary</em>, <em>Freckle</em>, and <em>SeeSaw</em>. What now?</p> -->

        <p>Twenty-four user interviews later, we realized that teachers were struggling to provide for students' social and emotional well-being. Young students would arrive on Zoom, sleepy, bored, late, and overall not in the right mindset to learn.</p>
        <br>

        <h2>The Process</h2>
        <p> After conducting our user interviews, we got to work sketching a user flow and first Figma drafts. We wanted our site to be fun and geared towards kids, so we chose fonts and a color scheme accordingly.</p>

        <!-- <div class="dan-images">

        </div> -->

        <br>
        <p> Through Zoom, we tested the site on elementary students to see how they would react.</p>
        <p> Some things we learned:</p>
        <ul>
          <li> They had trouble with the side navigation bar after clicking on a game. </li>
          <li> They spent time looking for the "Friends" tab. </li>
          <li> The site overall could look more fun. </li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Final Product</h2>
        <p>We presented our <a href="https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1zDksmOR9mxfVavUfVHOrwDmCK7fsdmwJoA1M82y8z5s/edit#slide=id.g8b40787702_1_244" target="_blank"> Pitch Deck</a> and <a href="https://www.figma.com/proto/GQoatXqpXxKocnut5GzkDY/Edutainment_wireframe?node-id=196%3A0&scaling=min-zoom" target="_blank">prototype demonstration</a> to a judge. </p>

      <h2>Things I Learned (and Re-Learned)</h2>
      <ul>
        <li> <strong>Importance of Planning:</strong> 
          <p>We planned and brainstormed a lot before jumping to the fun stuff. That process is crucial! </p>
        </li>
        <li> <strong>Trust and Flexibility:</strong> 
          <p>I recognized that we all work at different paces. We were ready to adjust if we tweaked our product vision, and we had each others' backs when interviewees were unavailable at the last minute.</p>
        </li>
        <li> <strong>Design for the Users:</strong> 
          <p>We kept asking ourselves, "Is this meeting the teacher's needs? How will this help the students? What features can we come up with?" Design with the mission in mind!</p>
        </li>
